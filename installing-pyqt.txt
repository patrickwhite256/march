One man's journey into installing PyQt5 in a Python3 (3.4) virtual env on Ubuntu. (Abridged)

- created python3 virtual env in march, added gitignore for bin/ and lib/ & whatever else
 - this seemed fine, so i cp -r'd the PyQt5.5 install dir into march &  ran python configure.py -e QtMultimedia ~ did not work. Error: /usr/bin/qmake failed to create a makefile from PyQt5.pro

  github.com/pyqt/python-qt5/wiki/Compiling-PyQt5-on-Ubuntu-12.04
  - this is good for me because it tells me what to put for the qmake option and also to use the sip option. I'm going to ignore the sip option though.

 - okay, following this site is going ok. i need to rebuild Sip. that failed because i dont have python3-dev package. I am currently sudo apt-get installing python3-dev
 - then i am going to recompile sip in the venv "make" (successful? yes)
 - then i am going to do sudo make intall there - ok
 - now returning to the PyQt dir and running configure.py with --sipdir ../sip_abc/siblib
 - i am noticing it said nothing about multimedia so i am re-running with -e QtMultimedia & MultimediaWidgets
 - okay it failed with -e QtMultimedia so I just let it go and i'm doing make on a configure run that did not have -e QtMultimedia...

 - i had to install some dev packages using apt
 sudo apt-get install qtmultimedia5-dev 
 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26948466/project-error-unknown-modules-in-qt-multimedia
 - now it's working. note* i did not include all of the apt packages i needed to install. so, that could be troublesome for people not using apt.

 - moved the venv stuff into a parent directory. if things stop working, i'll probably let everyone know.

Media isn't working, with a gstreamer error, so I am going to install more gstreamer libs. I have 0.10 but now I am trying to install 1.0-dev to see if that helps

Gstreamer error gotten rid of by fixing path (or something)
- no audio.
  Oh, is it that I forgot to install some OTHER package?
  Yes. sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5.qtmultimedia

  Still nothing. I'm kind of concerned?

  I might try to look at the gstreamer packages again. Website confirms that PyQt should use gstreamer0.10
  Maybe i need more decoders or plugins.
apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-bad0.10

Still nothing.
Hm. Trying to look through more examples and find out what I'm doing wrong.
MultimediaWidgets could be useful.
Ohp! I didn't compile with that module. Well fuck me backwards.
